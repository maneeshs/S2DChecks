# Storage Spaces Direct Diagnostic and Operations Checks
This project intends to provide a framework and a comprehensive set of Pester tests to perform diagnostics and operations validation of Storage Spaces Direct Clusters. 

The goal is to:
- Create Pester tests for most common diagnostic and operations checks
- Create a framework that can be used invoke these tests either on-demand and/or scheduled basis.
- Provide reporting of the test status as dashboard
- And, many more features that are still in design.

## Current Status ##
This repository, at the moment, is a placeholder. There are other community efforts (by @Arcontar) as well. We plan to consolidate all these into a PowerShell module that can be downloaded from PowerShell Gallery.

If you are interested in contributing, just tweet! 

If you have a set of tests that you want to get included in this module, drop a comment here (#1).
